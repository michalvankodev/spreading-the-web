HTTP/2 is the second major version of the HTTP network protocol It is based on SPDY. HTTP 1.1, which was standardized in RFC 2068 in 1997.  Proposed Standard in December 2014,The HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015.[8]
<br><br>
HTTP/2 uses SPDY as a jumping-off point. HTTP/2, however, uses a fixed Huffman code-based header compression algorithm, instead of SPDY's dynamic stream-based compression. This helps to reduce the potential for attacks on the protocol.
<br>
On February 9, 2015, Google announced plans to remove support for SPDY in Chrome by early 2016, in favor of support for HTTP/2, starting with Chrome 40.[19]
